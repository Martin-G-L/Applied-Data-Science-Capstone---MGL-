# IBM Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains the collection of Jupyter notebooks developed as part of the **Data Science Capstone Project** from the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera.

## 📌 Project Overview
The capstone project applies various data science techniques, including data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, machine learning modeling, and deployment, to solve a real-world problem. The project follows the standard data science workflow:

1. **Problem Definition**: Identifying the business problem and defining the scope.
2. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Gathering and preprocessing data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding patterns, trends, and relationships.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features to enhance model performance.
5. **Model Selection & Training**: Implementing machine learning models and tuning hyperparameters.
6. **Evaluation & Interpretation**: Assessing model accuracy and extracting insights.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **Dashboards** (Dash)

## 📊 Dataset
The datasets used for this project was obtained from [Space X Public API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/). It consists of data reguarding the sucess or faillures in recuperating the first module on Space X Lauches. 
## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Martin-G-L/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
6. Open and execute the notebooks sequentially.
